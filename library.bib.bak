abstract = {There has been much interest in unsupervised learning of hierarchical generative models such as deep belief networks. Scaling such models to full-sized, high-dimensional images remains a difficult problem. To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model which scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique which shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.},

abstract = {We explore an original strategy for building deep networks, based on stacking layers of denoising autoencoders which are trained locally to denoise corrupted versions of their inputs. The resulting algorithm is a straightforward variation on the stacking of ordinary autoencoders. It is however shown on a benchmark of classification problems to yield significantly lower classification error, thus bridging the performance gap with deep belief networks (DBN), and in several cases surpassing it. Higher level representations learnt in this purely unsupervised fashion also help boost the performance of subsequent SVM classifiers. Qualitative experiments show that, contrary to ordinary autoencoders, denoising autoencoders are able to learn Gabor-like edge detectors from natural image patches and larger stroke detectors from digit images. This work clearly establishes the value of using a denoising criterion as a tractable unsupervised objective to guide the learning of useful higher level representations. Â© 2010.},

abstract = {Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efficient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.},

abstract = {The natural language processing community has recently experienced a growth of interest in domain independent shallow semantic parsing-the process of assigning a Who did What to Whom, When, Where, Why, How etc. structure to plain text. This process entails identifying groups of words in a sentence that represent these semantic arguments and assigning specific labels to them. It could play a key role in NLP tasks like Information Extraction, Question Answering and Summarization. We propose a machine learning algorithm for semantic role parsing, extending the work of Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), Surdeanu et al. (2003) and others. Our algorithm is based on Support Vector Machines which we show give large improvement in performance over earlier classifiers. We show performance improvements through a number of new features designed to improve generalization to unseen data, such as automatic clustering of verbs. We also report on various analytic studies examining which features are most important, comparing our classifier to other machine learning algorithms in the literature, and testing its generalization to new test set from different genre. On the task of assigning semantic labels to the PropBank (Kingsbury, Palmer, & Marcus, 2002) corpus, our final system has a precision of 84% and a recall of 75%, which are the best results currently reported for this task. Finally, we explore a completely different architecture which does not requires a deep syntactic parse. We reformulate the task as a combined chunking and classification problem, thus allowing our algorithm to be applied to new languages or genres of text for which statistical syntactic parsers may not be available.},

abstract = {We show how to learn a deep graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. The values of the latent variables in the deepest layer are easy to infer and give a much better representation of each document than Latent Semantic Analysis. When the deepest layer is forced to use a small number of binary variables (e.g. 32), the graphical model performs "semantic hashing": Documents are mapped to memory addresses in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. By using semantic hashing to filter the documents given to TF-IDF, we achieve higher accuracy than applying TF-IDF to the entire document set. Â© 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recently, many applications for Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) have been developed for a large variety of learning problems. However, RBMs are usually used as feature extractors for another learning algorithm or to provide a good initialization for deep feed-forward neural network classifiers, and are not considered as a stand-alone solution to classification problems. In this paper, we argue that RBMs provide a self-contained framework for deriving competitive non-linear classifiers. We present an evaluation of different learning algorithms for RBMs which aim at introducing a discriminative component to RBM training and improve their performance as classifiers. This approach is simple in that RBMs are used directly to build a classifier, rather than as a stepping stone. Finally, we demonstrate how discriminative RBMs can also be successfully employed in a semi-supervised setting. Copyright 2008 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

abstract = {For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difficult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classifier. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We find that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We find that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of "deep" vs. "shallower" representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms.},

abstract = {Deep Belief Networks (DBN's) are generative models that contain many layers of hidden variables. Efficient greedy algorithms for learning and approximate inference have allowed these models to be applied successfully in many application domains. The main building block of a DBN is a bipartite undirected graphical model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Due to the presence of the partition function, model selection, complexity control, and exact maximum likelihood learning in RBM's are intractable. We show that Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) can be used to efficiently estimate the partition function of an RBM, and we present a novel AIS scheme for comparing RBM's with different architectures. We further show how an AIS estimator, along with approximate inference, can be used to estimate a lower bound on the log-probability that a DBN model with multiple hidden layers assigns to the test data. This is, to our knowledge, the first step towards obtaining quantitative results that would allow us to directly assess the performance of Deep Belief Networks as generative models of data.

abstract = {Many successful models for scene or object recognition transform low-level descriptors (such as Gabor filter responses, or SIFT descriptors) into richer representations of intermediate complexity. This process can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature. The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules (hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes (by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling. By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors, our approach aims to facilitate the design of better recognition architectures.},

Despite its ease of implementation, SGDs are difficult to tune and parallelize. These problems make it challenging to develop, debug and scale up deep learning algorithms with SGDs. In this paper, we show that more sophisticated off-the-shelf optimization methods such as Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS) and Conjugate gradient (CG) with line search can significantly simplify and speed up the process of pretraining deep algorithms. In our experiments, the difference between L-BFGS/CG and SGDs are more pronounced if we consider algorithmic extensions (e.g., sparsity regularization) and hardware extensions (e.g., GPUs or computer clusters). Our experiments with distributed optimization support the use of L-BFGS with locally connected networks and convolutional neural networks. Using L-BFGS, our convolutional network model achieves 0.69% on the standard MNIST dataset. This is a state-of-the-art result on MNIST among algorithms that do not use distortions or pretraining.

abstract = {The World Wide Web provides a nearly endless source of knowledge, which is mostly given in natural language. A first step towards exploiting this data automatically could be to extract pairs of a given semantic relation from text documents - for example all pairs of a person and her birth-date. One strategy for this task is to find text patterns that express the semantic relation, to generalize these patterns, and to apply them to a corpus to find new pairs. In this paper, we show that this approach profits significantly when deep linguistic structures are used instead of surface text patterns. We demonstrate how linguistic structures can be represented for machine learning, and we provide a theoretical analysis of the pattern matching approach. We show the benefits of our approach by extensive experiments with our prototype system LEILA. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

@article{Mierswa2005,
abstract = {Today many private households as well as broadcasting or film companies own large collections of digital music plays. These are time series that differ from e.g. weather reports or stocks market data. The task is normally that of classification not prediction of the next value or recognizing a shape or motif. New methods for extracting features that allow to classify audio data have been developed. However the development of appropriate feature extraction methods is a tedious effort particularly because every new classification task requires tailoring the feature set anew. This paper presents a unifying framework for feature extraction from value series. Operators of this framework can be combined to feature extraction methods automatically using a genetic programming approach. The construction of features is guided by the performance of the learning classifier which uses the features. Our approach to automatic feature extraction requires a balance between the completeness of the methods on one side and the tractability of searching for appropriate methods on the other side. In this paper some theoretical considerations illustrate the trade-off. After the feature extraction a second process learns a classifier from the transformed data. The practical use of the methods is shown by two types of experiments: classification of genres and classification according to user preferences. Â© 2005 Springer Science + Business Media Inc.},

abstract = {The author previously proposed a neural network model neocognitron for robust visual pattern recognition. This paper proposes an improved version of the neocognitron and demonstrates its ability using a large database of handwritten digits (ETL1). To improve the recognition rate of the neocognitron, several modifications have been applied: such as, the inhibitory surround in the connections from S-cells to C-cells, contrast-extracting layer between input and edge-extracting layers, self-organization of line-extracting cells, supervised competitive learning at the highest stage, staggered arrangement of S- and C-cells, and so on. These modifications allowed the removal of accessory circuits that were appended to the previous versions, resulting in an improvement of recognition rate as well as simplification of the network architecture. The recognition rate varies depending on the number of training patterns. When we used 3000 digits (300 patterns for each digit) for the learning, for example, the recognition rate was 98.6% for a blind test set (3000 digits), and 100% for the training set.},

abstract = {We show how to use "complementary priors" to eliminate the explaining-away effects that make inference difficult in densely connected belief nets that have many hidden layers. Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modeled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory, and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

Data-dependent expectations are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and dataindependent expectations are approximated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of expectation that enter into the gradient of the log-likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer "pre-training" phase that allows variational inference to be initialized with a single bottomup pass.

abstract = {Identifying and categorizing network traffic by application type is challenging because of the continued evolution of applications, especially of those with a desire to be undetectable. The diminished effectiveness of port-based identification and the overheads of deep packet inspection approaches motivate us to classify traffic by exploiting distinctive flow characteristics of applications when they communicate on a network. In this paper, we explore this latter approach and propose a semi-supervised classification method that can accommodate both known and unknown applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use semi-supervised learning techniques for the traffic classification problem. Our approach allows classifiers to be designed from training data that consists of only a few labeled and many unlabeled flows. We consider pragmatic classification issues such as longevity of classifiers and the need for retraining of classifiers. Our performance evaluation using empirical Internet traffic traces that span a 6-month period shows that: (1) high flow and byte classification accuracy (i.e.,Â greater than 90%) can be achieved using training data that consists of a small number of labeled and a large number of unlabeled flows; (2) presence of "mice" and "elephant" flows in the Internet complicates the design of classifiers, especially of those with high byte accuracy, and necessitates the use of weighted sampling techniques to obtain training flows; and (3) retraining of classifiers is necessary only when there are non-transient changes in the network usage characteristics. As a proof of concept, we implement prototype offline and realtime classification systems to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Â© 2007.},

abstract = {We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods.},

abstract = {Previous work on action recognition has focused on adapting hand-designed local features, such as SIFT or HOG, from static images to the video domain. In this paper, we propose using unsupervised feature learning as a way to learn features directly from video data. More specifically, we present an extension of the Independent Subspace Analysis algorithm to learn invariant spatio-temporal features from unlabeled video data. We discovered that, despite its simplicity, this method performs surprisingly well when combined with deep learning techniques such as stacking and convolution to learn hierarchical representations. By replacing hand-designed features with our learned features, we achieve classification results superior to all previous published results on the Hollywood2, UCF, KTH and YouTube action recognition datasets. On the challenging Hollywood2 and YouTube action datasets we obtain 53.3% and 75.8% respectively, which are approximately 5% better than the current best published results. Further benefits of this method, such as the ease of training and the efficiency of training and prediction, will also be discussed.

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sults reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bod- ies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accu- racy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative im- provement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Recent developments have demonstrated the capacity of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to be powerful generative models, able to extract useful features from input data or construct deep artificial neural networks. In such settings, the RBMonly yields a preprocessing or an initialization for some other model, instead of acting as a complete supervised model in its own right. In this paper, we argue that RBMs can provide a self-contained framework for developing competitive classifiers. We study the Classification RBM (ClassRBM), a variant on the RBM adapted to the classification setting. We study different strategies for training the ClassRBM and show that competitive classification performances can be reached when appropriately combining discriminative and generative training objectives. Since training according to the generative objective requires the computation of a generally intractable gradient, we also compare different approaches to estimating this gradient and address the issue of obtaining such a gradient for problems with very high dimensional inputs. Finally, we describe how to adapt the ClassRBM to two special cases of classification problems, namely semi-supervised and multitask learning.

Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under different lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modified version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error.},

Importantly, throughout our work we are able to make comparison with data possessing an accurate, independently determined ground-truth that describes the actual applications causing the network-traffic observed. In a unique study in both the spatial-domain: comparing across different network-locations and in the temporal-domain: comparing across a number of years of data, we illustrate the decay in classification accuracy across a range of application-classification mechanisms. Further, we document the accuracy of spatial classification without training data possessing spatial diversity. Finally, we illustrate the classification of UDP traffic. We use the same classification approach for both stateful flows (TCP) and stateless flows based upon UDP. Importantly, we demonstrate high levels of accuracy: greater than 92% for the worst circumstance regardless of the application. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of training a deep network with billions of parameters using tens of thousands of CPU cores. We have developed a software framework called DistBelief that can utilize computing clusters with thousands of machines to train large models. Within this framework, we have developed two algorithms for large-scale distributed training: (i) Downpour SGD, an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent procedure supporting a large number of model replicas, and (ii) Sandblaster, a framework that supports a variety of distributed batch optimization procedures, including a distributed implementation of L-BFGS. Downpour SGD and Sandblaster L-BFGS both increase the scale and speed of deep network training. We have successfully used our system to train a deep network 30x larger than previously reported in the literature, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet, a visual object recognition task with 16 million images and 21k categories. We show that these same techniques dramatically accelerate the training of a more modestly- sized deep network for a commercial speech recognition service.

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day},

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces "stroke detectors" when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps.},

In this paper, we propose deep learning as a natural source for obtaining additional, complementary representations. To learn features in high-resolution images, we make use of convolutional deep belief networks. Moreover, to take advantage of global structure in an object class, we develop local convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines, a novel convolutional learning model that exploits the global structure by not assuming stationarity of features across the image, while maintaining scalability and robustness to small misalignments. We also present a novel application of deep learning to descriptors other than pixel intensity values, such as LBP. In addition, we compare performance of networks trained using unsupervised learning against networks with random filters, and empirically show that learning weights not only is necessary for obtaining good multilayer representations, but also provides robustness to the choice of the network architecture parameters. Finally, we show that a recognition system using only representations obtained from deep learning can achieve comparable accuracy with a system using a combination of hand-crafted image descriptors. Moreover, by combining these representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-world face verification database. Â© 2012 IEEE.},

This approach can be used to train autoencoders, and these denoising autoencoders can be stacked to initialize deep architectures. The algorithm can be motivated from a manifold learning and information theoretic perspective or from a generative model perspective. Comparative experiments clearly show the surprising advantage of corrupting the input of autoencoders on a pattern classification benchmark suite. Copyright 2008 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

The various applications are categorised into a novel two-dimensional taxonomy for image processing algorithms. One dimension specifies the type of task performed by the algorithm: preprocessing, data reduction/feature extraction, segmentation, object recognition, image understanding and optimisation. The other dimension captures the abstraction level of the input data processed by the algorithm: pixel-level, local feature-level, structure-level, object-level, object-set-level and scene characterisation. Each of the six types of tasks poses specific constraints to a neural-based approach. These specific conditions are discussed in detail. A synthesis is made of unresolved problems related to the application of pattern recognition techniques in image processing and specifically to the application of neural networks. Finally, we present an outlook into the future application of neural networks and relate them to novel developments.},

abstract = {Learning involves the integration of new information into existing knowledge. Generating explanations to oneself (self-explaining) facilitates that integration process. Previously, self-explanation has been shown to improve the acquisition of problem-solving skills when studying worked-out examples. This study extends that finding, showing that self-explanation can also be facilitative when it is explicitly promoted, in the context of learning declarative knowledge from an expository text. Without any extensive training, 14 eighth-grade students were merely asked to self-explain after reading each line of a passage on the human circulatory system. Ten students in the control group read the same text twice, but were not prompted to self-explain. All of the students were tested for their circulatory system knowledge before and after reading the text. The prompted group had a greater gain from the pretest to the posttest. Moreover, prompted students who generated a large number of self-explanations (the high explainers) learned with greater understanding than low explainers. Understanding was assessed by answering very complex questions and inducing the function of a component when it was only implicitly stated. Understanding was further captured by a mental model analysis of the self-explanation protocols. High explainers all achieved the correct mental model of the circulatory system, whereas many of the unprompted students as well as the low explainers did not. Three processing characteristics of self-explaining are considered as reasons for the gains in deeper understanding. Â© 1994.},

abstract = {Recently there has been a great deal of attention paid to the automatic prediction of tags for music and audio in general. Social tags are user-generated keywords associated with some resource on the Web. In the case of music, social tags have become an important component of "Web 2.0" recommender systems. There have been many attempts at automatically applying tags to audio for different purposes: database management, music recommendation, improved human-computer interfaces, estimating similarity among songs, and so on. Many published results show that this problem can be tackled using machine learning techniques, however, no method so far has been proven to be particularly suited to the task. First, it seems that no one has yet found an appropriate algorithm to solve this challenge. But second, the task definition itself is problematic. In an effort to better understand the task and also to help new researchers bring their insights to bear on this problem, this chapter provides a review of the state-of-the-art methods for addressing automatic tagging of audio. It is divided in the following sections: goal, framework, audio representation, labeled data, classification, evaluation, and future directions. Such a division helps understand the commonalities and strengths of the different methods that have been proposed. Â© 2011, IGI Global.},

abstract = {Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization often appears to get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently proposed a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning procedure relying on the training algorithm of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) to initialize the parameters of a deep belief network (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. This was followed by the proposal of another greedy layer-wise procedure, relying on the usage of autoassociator networks. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study these algorithms empirically to better understand their success. Our experiments confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy helps the optimization by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, but also implicitly acts as a sort of regularization that brings better generalization and encourages internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input. We also present a series of experiments aimed at evaluating the link between the performance of deep neural networks and practical aspects of their topology, for example, demonstrating cases where the addition of more depth helps. Finally, we empirically explore simple variants of these training algorithms, such as the use of different RBM input unit distributions, a simple way of combining gradient estimators to improve performance, as well as on-line versions of those algorithms.},

abstract = {One long-term goal of machine learning research is to produce methods that are applicable to highly complex tasks, such as perception (vision, audition), rea- soning, intelligent control, and other artificially intelligent behaviors. We argue that in order to progress toward this goal, the Machine Learning community must endeavor to discover algorithms that can learn highly complex functions, withmin- imal need for prior knowledge, and with minimal human intervention. We present mathematical and empirical evidence suggesting that many popular approaches to non-parametric learning, particularly kernel methods, are fundamentally lim- ited in their ability to learn complex high-dimensional functions. Our analysis focuses on two problems. First, kernel machines are shallow architectures, in which one large layer of simple template matchers is followed by a single layer of trainable coefficients. We argue that shallow architectures can be very ineffi- cient in terms of required number of computational elements and examples. Sec- ond, we analyze a limitation of kernel machines with a local kernel, linked to the curse of dimensionality, that applies to supervised, unsupervised (manifold learn- ing) and semi-supervised kernel machines. Using empirical results on invariant image recognition tasks, kernel methods are compared with deep architectures, in which lower-level features or concepts are progressively combined into more ab- stract and higher-level representations. We argue that deep architectures have the potential to generalize in non-local ways, i.e., beyond immediate neighbors, and that this is crucial in order to make progress on the kind of complex tasks required for artificial intelligence. 1},

Backpropagation was the first computationally efficient model of how neural networks could learn multiple layers of representation, but it required labeled training data and it did not work well in deep networks. The limitations of backpropagation learning can now be overcome by using multilayer neural networks that contain top-down connections and training them to generate sensory data rather than to classify it.

abstract = {Most classification algorithms are best at categorizing the Web documents into a few categories, such as the top two levels in the Open Directory Project. Such a classification method does not give very detailed topic-related class information for the user because the first two levels are often too coarse. However, classification on a large-scale hierarchy is known to be intractable for many target categories with cross-link relationships among them. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-classification approach to categorize Web documents into categories in a large-scale taxonomy. The approach consists of two stages: a search stage and a classification stage. In the first stage, a category-search algorithm is used to acquire the category candidates for a given document. Based on the category candidates, we prune the large-scale hierarchy to focus our classification effort on a small subset of the original hierarchy. As a result, the classification model is trained on the small subset before being applied to assign the category for a new document. Since the category candidates are sufficiently close to each other in the hierarchy, a statistical-language-model based classifier using n-gram features is exploited. Furthermore, the structure of the taxonomy can be utilized in this stage to improve the performance of classification. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms on the Open Directory Project with, over 130,000 categories. Experimental results show that our proposed approach can reach 51.8% on the measure of Mi-Fl at the 5th level, which is 77.7% improvement over top-down based SVM classification algorithms.

Due to its unsupervised nature, it requires filtering mechanisms to rate the importance and correctness of the extracted knowledge. This paper presents OntoCmaps, a domain-independent and open ontology learning tool that extracts deep semantic representations from corpora. OntoCmaps generates rich conceptual representations in the form of concept maps and proposes an innovative filtering mechanism based on metrics from graph theory. Our results show that using metrics such as Betweenness, PageRank, Hits and Degree centrality outperforms the results of standard text-based metrics (TF-IDF, term frequency) for concept identification. We propose voting schemes based on these metrics that provide a good performance in relationship identification, which again provides better results (in terms of precision and F-measure) than other traditional metrics such as frequency of co-occurrences. The approach is evaluated against a gold standard and is compared to the ontology learning tool Text2Onto. The OntoCmaps generated ontology is more expressive than Text2Onto ontology especially in conceptual relationships and leads to better results in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.

abstract = {Most words in English are ambiguous between different interpretations; words can mean different things in different contexts. We investigate the implications of different types of semantic ambiguity for connectionist models of word recognition. We present a model in which there is competition to activate distributed semantic representations. The model performs well on the task of retrieving the different meanings of ambiguous words, and is able to simulate data reported by Rodd, Gaskell, and Marslen-Wilson [J. Mem. Lang. 46 (2002) 245] on how semantic ambiguity affects lexical decision performance. In particular, the network shows a disadvantage for words with multiple unrelated meanings (e.g., bark) that coexists with a benefit for words with multiple related word senses (e.g., twist). The ambiguity disadvantage arises because of interference between the different meanings, while the sense benefit arises because of differences in the structure of the attractor basins formed during learning. Words with few senses develop deep, narrow attractor basins, while words with many senses develop shallow, broad basins. We conclude that the mental representations of word meanings can be modelled as stable states within a high-dimensional semantic space, and that variations in the meanings of words shape the landscape of this space.

abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

abstract = {The promise of unsupervised learning methods lies in their potential to use vast amounts of unlabeled data to learn complex, highly nonlinear models with millions of free parameters. We consider two well-known unsupervised learning models, deep belief networks (DBNs) and sparse coding, that have recently been applied to a flurry of machine learning applications (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; Raina et al., 2007). Unfortunately, current learning algorithms for both models are too slow for large-scale applications, forcing researchers to focus on smaller-scale models, or to use fewer training examples. In this paper, we suggest massively parallel methods to help resolve these problems. We argue that modern graphics processors far surpass the computational capabilities of multicore CPUs, and have the potential to revolutionize the applicability of deep unsupervised learning methods. We develop general principles for massively parallelizing unsupervised learning tasks using graphics processors. We show that these principles can be applied to successfully scaling up learning algorithms for both DBNs and sparse coding. Our implementation of DBN learning is up to 70 times faster than a dual-core CPU implementation for large models. For example, we are able to reduce the time required to learn a four-layer DBN with 100 million free parameters from several weeks to around a single day. For sparse coding, we develop a simple, inherently parallel algorithm, that leads to a 5 to 15-fold speedup over previous methods.},

The SOM provides a quantization of the image samples into a topological space where inputs that are nearby in the original space are also nearby in the output space, thereby providing dimensionality reduction and invariance to minor changes in the image sample, and the convolutional neural network provides partial invariance to translation, rotation, scale, and deformation. The convolutional network extracts successively larger features in a hierarchical set of layers. We present results using the Karhunen-Loeve transform in place of the SOM, and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) in place of the convolutional network for comparison. We use a database of 400 images of 40 individuals which contains quite a high degree of variability in expression, pose, and facial details. We analyze the computational complexity and discuss how new classes could be added to the trained recognizer.},

abstract = {Scene labeling consists of labeling each pixel in an image with the category of the object it belongs to. We propose a method that uses a multiscale convolutional network trained from raw pixels to extract dense feature vectors that encode regions of multiple sizes centered on each pixel. The method alleviates the need for engineered features, and produces a powerful representation that captures texture, shape, and contextual information. We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations. The system yields record accuracies on the SIFT Flow dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona dataset (170 classes) and near-record accuracy on Stanford background dataset (eight classes), while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches, producing a $(320\times 240)$ image labeling in less than a second, including feature extraction.},

abstract = {Neural network (NN) bottleneck (BN) features are typically created by training a NN with a middle bottleneck layer. Recently, an alternative structure was proposed which trains a NN with a constant number of hidden units to predict output targets, and then reduces the dimensionality of these output probabilities through an auto-encoder, to create auto-encoder bottleneck (AE-BN) features. The benefit of placing the BN after the posterior estimation network is that it avoids the loss in frame classification accuracy incurred by networks that place the BN before the softmax. In this work, we investigate the use of pre-training when creating AE-BN features. Our experiments indicate that with the AE-BN architecture, pre-trained and deeper NNs produce better AE-BN features. On a 50-hour English Broadcast News task, the AE-BN features provide over a 1% absolute improvement compared to a state-of-the-art GMM/HMM with a WER of 18.8% and pre-trained NN hybrid system with a WER of 18.4%. In addition, on a larger 430-hour Broadcast News task, AE-BN features provide a 0.5% absolute improvement over a strong GMM/HMM baseline with a WER of 16.0%. Finally, system combination with the GMM/HMM baseline and AE-BN systems provides an additional 0.5% absolute on 430 hours over the AE-BN system alone, yielding a final WER of 15.0%. Â© 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Deep belief networks (DBN) are generative neural network models with many layers of hidden explanatory factors, recently introduced by Hinton, Osindero, and Teh (2006) along with a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm. The building block of a DBN is a probabilistic model called a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), used to represent one layer of the model. Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power. This suggests a new and less greedy criterion for training RBMs within DBNs.},

abstract = {Recently, pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) have outperformed traditional acoustic models based on Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on a variety of large vocabulary speech recognition benchmarks. Deep neural nets have also achieved excellent results on various computer vision tasks using a random 'dropout' procedure that drastically improves generalization error by randomly omitting a fraction of the hidden units in all layers. Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time. Neural networks with rectified linear unit (ReLU) non-linearities have been highly successful for computer vision tasks and proved faster to train than standard sigmoid units, sometimes also improving discriminative performance. In this work, we show on a 50-hour English Broadcast News task that modified deep neural networks using ReLUs trained with dropout during frame level training provide an 4.2% relative improvement over a DNN trained with sigmoid units, and a 14.4% relative improvement over a strong GMM/HMM system.

abstract = {We consider problems involving groups of data where each observation within a group is a draw from a mixture model and where it is desirable to share mixture components between groups. We assume that the number of mixture components is unknown a priori and is to be inferred from the data. In this setting it is natural to consider sets of Dirichlet processes, one for each group, where the well-known clustering properly of the Dirichlet process provides a nonparametric prior for the number of mixture components within each group. Given our desire to tie the mixture models in the various groups, we consider a hierarchical model, specifically one in which the base measure for the child Dirichlet processes is itself distributed according to a Dirichlet process. Such a base measure being discrete, the child Dirichlet processes necessarily share atoms. Thus, as desired, the mixture models in the different groups necessarily share mixture components. We discuss representations of hierarchical Dirichlet processes in terms of a stick-breaking process, and a generalization of the Chinese restaurant process that we refer to as the "Chinese restaurant franchise." We present Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for posterior inference in hierarchical Dirichlet process mixtures and describe applications to problems in information retrieval and text modeling.

GPs have been applied in a large number of fields to a diverse range of ends, and very many deep theoretical analyses of various properties are available. This paper gives an introduction to Gaussian processes on a fairly elementary level with special emphasis on characteristics relevant in machine learning. It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications. In this tutorial paper, we aim to present characteristics of GPs relevant to machine learning and to show up precise connections to other "kernel machines" popular in the community.

Even though these new algorithms have enabled training deep models, many questions remain as to the nature of this difficult learning problem. The main question investigated here is the following: how does unsupervised pre-training work? Answering this questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We propose several explanatory hypotheses and test them through extensive simulations. We empirically show the influence of pre-training with respect to architecture depth, model capacity, and number of training examples. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. The results suggest that unsupervised pre-training guides the learning towards basins of attraction of minima that support better generalization from the training data set; the evidence from these results supports a regularization explanation for the effect of pre-training.},

abstract = {Automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge is critical to a wide range of natural language processing tasks. Especially important is knowledge about verbs, which are the primary source of relational information in a sentence - the predicate-argument structure that relates an action or state to its participants (i.e., who did what to whom). In this work, we report on supervised learning experiments to automatically classify three major types of English verbs, based on their argument structure - specifically, the thematic roles they assign to participants. We use linguistically-motivated statistical indicators extracted from large annotated corpora to train the classifier, achieving 69.8% accuracy for a task whose baseline is 34%, and whose expert-based upper bound we calculate at 86.5%. A detailed analysis of the performance of the algorithm and of its errors confirms that the proposed features capture properties related to the argument structure of the verbs. Our results validate our hypotheses that knowledge about thematic relations is crucial for verb classification, and that it can be gleaned from a corpus by automatic means. We thus demonstrate an effective combination of deeper linguistic knowledge with the robustness and scalability of statistical techniques.},

abstract = {For many years, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been studied and used to model information processing systems based on or inspired by biological neural structures. They not only can provide solutions with improved performance when compared with traditional problem-solving methods, but also give a deeper understanding of human cognitive abilities. Among various existing neural network architectures and learning algorithms, Kohonen's selforganizing map (SOM) [46] is one of the most popular neural network models. Developed for an associative memory model, it is an unsupervised learning algorithm with a simple structure and computational form, and is motivated by the retina-cortex mapping. Self-organization in general is a fundamental pattern recognition process, in which intrinsic inter- and intra-pattern relationships among the stimuli and responses are learnt without the presence of a potentially biased or subjective external influence. The SOM can provide topologically preserved mapping from input to output spaces. Although the computational form of the SOM is very simple, numerous researchers have already examined the algorithm and many of its problems, nevertheless research in this area goes deeper and deeper - there are still many aspects to be exploited. In this Chapter, we review the background, theories and statistical properties of this important learning model and present recent advances from various pattern recognition aspects through a number of case studies and applications. The SOM is optimal for vector quantization. Its topographical ordering provides the mapping with enhanced fault- and noise-tolerant abilities. It is also applicable to many other applications, such as dimensionality reduction, data visualization, clustering and classification. Various extensions of the SOM have been devised since its introduction to extend the mapping as effective solutions for a wide range of applications. Its connections with other learning paradigms and application aspects are also exploited. The Chapter is intended to serve as an updated, extended tutorial, a review, as well as a reference for advanced topics in the subject. Â© 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.},

abstract = {The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called ldquoImageNetrdquo, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.},

abstract = {In this invited paper, my overview material on the same topic as presented in the plenary overview session of APSIPA-2011 and the tutorial material presented in the same conference [1] are expanded and updated to include more recent developments in deep learning. The previous and the updated materials cover both theory and applications, and analyze its future directions. The goal of this tutorial survey is to introduce the emerging area of deep learning or hierarchical learning to the APSIPA community. Deep learning refers to a class of machine learning techniques, developed largely since 2006, where many stages of non-linear information processing in hierarchical architectures are exploited for pattern classification and for feature learning. In the more recent literature, it is also connected to representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher- level concepts are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level concepts help to define higher-level ones. In this tutorial survey, a brief history of deep learning research is discussed first. Then, a classificatory scheme is developed to analyze and summarize major work reported in the recent deep learning literature. Using this scheme, I provide a taxonomy-oriented survey on the existing deep architectures and algorithms in the literature, and categorize them into three classes: generative, discriminative, and hybrid. Three representative deep architectures â deep autoencoders, deep stacking networks with their generalization to the temporal domain (recurrent networks), and deep neural networks (pretrained with deep belief networks) â one in each of the three classes, are presented in more detail. Next, selected applications of deep learning are reviewed in broad areas of signal and information processing including audio/speech, image/vision, multimodality, language modeling, natural language processing, and information retrieval. Finally, future directions of deep learning are discussed and analyzed.},

abstract = {It is possible to combine multiple latent-variable models of the same data by multiplying their probability distributions together and then renormalizing. This way of combining individual "expert" models makes it hard to generate samples from the combined model but easy to infer the values of the latent variables of each expert, because the combination rule ensures that the latent variables of different experts are conditionally independent when given the data. A product of experts (PoE) is therefore an interesting candidate for a perceptual system in which rapid inference is vital and generation is unnecessary. Training a PoE by maximizing the likelihood of the data is difficult because it is hard even to approximate the derivatives of the renormalization term in the combination rule. Fortunately, a PoE can be trained using a different objective function called "contrastive divergence" whose derivatives with regard to the parameters can be approximated accurately and efficiently. Examples are presented of contrastive divergence learning using several types of expert on several types of data.},

These networks are first pre-trained as a multi-layer generative model of a window of spectral feature vectors without making use of any discriminative information. Once the generative pre-training has designed the features, we perform discriminative fine-tuning using backpropagation to adjust the features slightly to make them better at predicting a probability distribution over the states of monophone hidden Markov models.},

abstract = {High quality domain ontologies are essential for successful employment of semantic Web services. However, their acquisition is difficult and costly, thus hampering the development of this field. In this paper we report on the first stage of research that aims to develop (semi-)automatic ontology learning tools in the context of Web services that can support domain experts in the ontology building task. The goal of this first stage was to get a better understanding of the problem at hand and to determine which techniques might be feasible to use. To this end, we developed a framework for (semi-)automatic ontology learning from textual sources attached to Web services. The framework exploits the fact that these sources are expressed in a specific sublanguage, making them amenable to automatic analysis. We implement two methods in this framework, which differ in the complexity of the employed linguistic analysis. We evaluate the methods in two different domains, verifying the quality of the extracted ontologies against high quality hand-built ontologies of these domains. Our evaluation lead to a set of valuable conclusions on which further work can be based. First, it appears that our method, while tailored for the Web services context, might be applicable across different domains. Second, we concluded that deeper linguistic analysis is likely to lead to better results. Finally, the evaluation metrics indicate that good results can be achieved using only relatively simple, off the shelf techniques. Indeed, the novelty of our work is not in the used natural language processing methods but rather in the way they are put together in a generic framework specialized for the context of Web services.

@article{Ferragina2005,
abstract = {We provide a general boosting technique for Textual Data Compression. Qualitatively, it takes a good compression algorithm and turns it into an algorithm with a better compression performance guarantee. It displays the following remarkable properties: (a) it can turn any memoryless compressor into a compression algorithm that uses the "best possible" contexts; (b) it is very simple and optimal in terms of time; and (c) it admits a decompression algorithm again optimal in time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first boosting technique displaying these properties. Technically, our boosting technique builds upon three main ingredients: the Burrows-Wheeler Transform, the Suffix Tree data structure, and a greedy algorithm to process them. Specifically, we show that there exists a proper partition of the Burrows-Wheeler Transform of a string 5 that shows a deep combinatorial relation with the kth order entropy of s. That partition can be identified via a greedy processing of the suffix tree of s with the aim of minimizing a proper objective function over its nodes. The final compressed string is then obtained by compressing individually each substring of the partition by means of the base compressor we wish to boost. Our boosting technique is inherently combinatorial because it does not need to assume any prior probabilistic model about the source emitting s, and it does not deploy any training, parameter estimation and learning. Various corollaries are derived from this main achievement. Among the others, we show analytically that using our booster, we get better compression algorithms than some of the best existing ones, that is, LZ77, LZ78, PPMC and the ones derived from the Burrows-Wheeler Transform. Further, we settle analytically some long-standing open problems about the algorithmic structure and the performance of BWT-based compressors. Namely, we provide the first family of BWT algorithms that do not use Move-To-Front or Symbol Ranking as a part of the compression process.Â© 2005 ACM.},
