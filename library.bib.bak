	discover multiple levels of distributed representations, with higher
	levels representing more abstract concepts. Although the study of
	deep learning has already led to impressive theoretical results,
	learning algorithms and breakthrough experiments, several challenges

	centering on the questions of scaling deep learning algorithms to
	much larger models and datasets, reducing optimization difficulties
	due to ill-conditioning or local minima, designing more efficient
	and powerful inference and sampling procedures, and learning to disentangle
	the factors of variation underlying the observed data. It also proposes
	a few forward-looking research directions aimed at overcoming these

  abstract = {Many successful models for scene or object recognition transform low-level
	descriptors (such as Gabor filter responses, or SIFT descriptors)
	into richer representations of intermediate complexity. This process
	can often be broken down into two steps: (1) a coding step, which
	performs a pointwise transformation of the descriptors into a representation
	better adapted to the task, and (2) a pooling step, which summarizes
	the coded features over larger neighborhoods. Several combinations
	of coding and pooling schemes have been proposed in the literature.
	The goal of this paper is threefold. We seek to establish the relative
	importance of each step of mid-level feature extraction through a
	comprehensive cross evaluation of several types of coding modules
	(hard and soft vector quantization, sparse coding) and pooling schemes
	(by taking the average, or the maximum), which obtains state-of-the-art
	performance or better on several recognition benchmarks. We show
	how to improve the best performing coding scheme by learning a supervised
	discriminative dictionary for sparse coding. We provide theoretical
	and empirical insight into the remarkable performance of max pooling.
	By teasing apart components shared by modern mid-level feature extractors,

  journal = {Found. Trends Signal Process.},
  year = {2013},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {197----387},
  abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning
	methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information
	processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following
	three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the
	application areas that have already been transformed by the successful
	use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer
	vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be
	impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated
	research efforts, including natural language and text processing,
	information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered
	by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background
	of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple
	layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory
	signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature,
	deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which
	involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations
	of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level
	representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a
	brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular,
	selected chronological development of speech recognition is used
	to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become
	a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only
	a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and
	industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition.
	In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body
	of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number
	of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid
	categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature
	survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss
	in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods,
	one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as
	a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques.
	Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category,
	which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised
	learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative,
	unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and
	several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify
	the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the
	three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set
	of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse
	areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial
	intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning
	to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition
	organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we
	present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling
	and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected
	applications of deep learning to information retrieval including
	Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep
	learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected
	applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task
	learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given
	in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters
	and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

	layers, self-organization of line-extracting cells, supervised competitive
	learning at the highest stage, staggered arrangement of S- and C-cells,

	that were appended to the previous versions, resulting in an improvement
	of recognition rate as well as simplification of the network architecture.
	The recognition rate varies depending on the number of training patterns.
	When we used 3000 digits (300 patterns for each digit) for the learning,

	variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques.
	Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules

	(GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using
	gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure.
	Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments
	demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility
	of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading
